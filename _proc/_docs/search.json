After all the group repositories are created, the command GitHubGroup.resent_invitations_team_repos will rescind all pending invitations and resent invitation to that collaborators.\nThis command is particularly useful when managing a large volume of repositories as it painlessly re-validated and re-sent all pending invitations of all repositories under a team. We ran this command daily to constantly remind student to accept their GitHub invitations, until all students have a valid permission to the target
