Did not describe the data obtained at those sources\nA key data source was not referenced or described in satisfactory level of detail\nAll relevant data sources were referenced and described in terms of their key variables and size\nMultiple data sources for each aspect of the project, All data sources are fully described and referenced. The details of the descriptions also make it clear how they support the needs ot the project.\n1.5\n\n\nProposed Solution\nLacks most details needed to undersstand the process. Or seems completely unrealistic to accomplish in the scope of this class\nA key detail to understand the process was not described well enough\nAll elements needed to understand the process were described in sufficient detail\nThe elements of the process were described succintly and with clarity about how they are connected to each other\n1.5\n\n\nMetrics\nLacks any metrics or at least metrics that are relevant to the problem\nSome metrics selected are not appropriate for the problem or the metrics selected are not described sufficiently\nAll metrics described are appropriate and and described sufficiently\nThe metrics are described clearly and succinctly. Their appropriateness for addressing the research problem is clearly described.\n1.5\n\n\nTeam expectations\nLack of expectations\nThe list of expectations feels incomplete and perfunctory\nIt feels like the list of expectations is complete and seems appropriate\nThe list clearly was the subject of a thoughtful approach and already indicates a well-working team\n0.25\n\n\nTimeline\nLack of timeline. Or timeline is completely unrealistic\nThe timeline feels incomplete and perfunctory. The timeline feels either too fast or too slow for the progress you expect a group can make\nIt feels like the timeline is complete and approriate. it can likely be completed as is in the available amount of time\nThe timeline was clearly the subject of a thoughtful approach and indicates that the team has a detailed plan that seems approriate and completeable in the allotted time.\n0.25"
