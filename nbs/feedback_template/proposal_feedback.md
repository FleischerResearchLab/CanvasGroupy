| **Problem Statement** | Research issue remains unclear. The research purpose, questions, hypotheses, definitions or variables, and controls are still largely undefined, or when they are poorly formed, ambiguous, or not logically connected to the description of the problem. Unclear whether the research problem is quantifiable, measurable, and replicable. | Research issue is identified, but the statement is too broad or fails to establish the importance of the problem.

| **Background**        | Did not have at least 2 reliable and relevant sources. Or relevant sources were not used in relevant ways                                                                                                                                                                                           | A key component was not connected to the research literature. Selected literature was from unreliable sources. Literary supports were vague or ambiguous.                                                                                                                                                                           | Key research components were connected to relevant, reliable theoretical and research literature.                                                                                                                                                             | Narrative integrates critical and logical details from the peer-reviewed theoretical and research literature. Each key research component is grounded in the literature. Attention is given to different perspectives, threats to validity, and opinion vs. evidence.                                                            |
| **Proposed Solution**        | Lacks most details; vague or interpretable in different ways.
