Variables and controls have been identified and described. Connections are established with the literature. | Presents a significant research problem. Articulates clear, reasonable research questions given the purpose, design, and methods of the project. All variables and controls have been appropriately defined. Proposals are clearly supported from the research and theoretical literature. All elements are mutually supportive. | Research issue remains unclear. The research purpose, questions, hypotheses, definitions or variables and controls are still largely undefined, or when they are are poorly formed, ambiguous, or not logically connected to the description of the problem.

| **Background**        | A key component was not connected to the research literature. Selected literature was from unreliable sources.

| **Ethics**            | Minimal ethical section; probably just talks about data privacy and no unintended consequences discussion. Ethical concerns raised seem irrelevant.                                                                                                                                                                                 | Ethical concerns described are appropriate and described sufficiently                                                                                                                                                                                         | Ethical concerns are described clearly and succinctly.
