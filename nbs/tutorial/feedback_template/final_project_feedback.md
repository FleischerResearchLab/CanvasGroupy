| Metrics                 | 1.25       | The metrics are described clearly and succinctly. <br>Their appropriateness for addressing the research problem is clearly described.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Results                 | 1.25       | Does a good model/hyper-parameter selection using more than one model and hyperparameter in hyperparameter search. <br>Include the detailed code and analysis results of the main points<br>Performs multiple secondary analysis such as learning curves, heat maps looking at where in the parameter space things are good/bad, uses statistical testing                                 |
| Interpreting the result | 1.25       | Think clearly about the results and obtain one main point and 2-4 secondary points (2-5 sentences per point).<br>Highlight HOW the results support those points. Understand what they are doing in the previous “Results” section                                                                                                                                                         |
